## Literature Review

### Introduction

Crop mapping plays a pivotal role in agricultural decision-making, particularly for smallholder farmers who face unique challenges and rely heavily on efficient resource management and accurate agricultural information. The accurate delineation of cropland areas not only informs resource allocation but also directly impacts the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, contributing to food security, sustainable practices, climate resilience, and economic stability. Smallholders, constituting a significant portion of the global agricultural workforce, operate with constrained resources and are vulnerable to external shocks such as climate change and economic instability. Therefore, precise crop segmentation is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and guiding sustainable agricultural practices. Leveraging insights from recent research, such as the work by Kerner et al. (2020), which highlights the urgent need for timely crop maps during crises by utilizing machine learning and satellite imagery to produce high-resolution cropland maps within days, this literature review delves into the critical necessity of rapid response crop mapping, particularly in data-sparse regions dominated by small-scale farming.

### Crop Definitions and Classifications

Crop definitions and classifications are critical components of agricultural research, essential for optimizing land use and informing policies tailored to smallholder farming systems. Research studies focusing on advancing crop classification within smallholder agriculture shed light on innovative methodologies and their direct relevance to smallholder economies.

The study by Kerner et al. (2020) employs a comprehensive approach that combines frequency-domain image co-registration, transformer-based parcel segmentation, and Bi-LSTM deep learning for precise crop classification. Key insights from this research include the use of delineated vegetation parcels through the Segment Anything Model for Geospatial (SAM-GEOs), which aids in accurate crop mapping, and the application of the Bi-LSTM deep learning model achieving impressive validation accuracy rates exceeding 94% and 96%. This approach directly benefits smallholder economies by optimizing remote sensing-based crop mapping, offering valuable insights for resource management and decision-making.

Additionally, the work on unlocking large-scale crop field delineation in smallholder farming systems (2022) highlights the importance of transfer learning and weak supervision techniques. Leveraging pre-trained models enhances the ability to delineate crop fields accurately, aiding in mapping crop types and predicting yields, which are valuable insights for smallholder farmers. Furthermore, studies focusing on farm typology and classification of smallholder farmers in South Africa (2021) underscore the complexities associated with defining and classifying smallholder farming systems. These studies advocate for simplified classification methods based on livelihoods to better serve the diverse needs of smallholder communities and inform targeted support systems.

In summary, these research findings contribute to advancing crop segmentation methodologies specifically tailored for smallholder farming contexts, facilitating informed decision-making, sustainable agricultural practices, and enhanced livelihoods.

### Technologies and Methods for Crop Detection

Accurate crop detection in smallholder farming systems relies on innovative technologies and methods, particularly the integration of satellite imagery and machine learning techniques. These advancements are essential for overcoming resource limitations and optimizing agricultural practices in data-sparse regions.

Satellite imagery platforms such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), offer valuable multispectral and radar data. Sentinel-1’s Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is particularly useful for all-weather monitoring, especially in areas prone to cloud cover, while Sentinel-2’s multispectral imagery captures information across different wavelengths, aiding in crop classification. Importantly, these platforms provide free and open-access data, making them highly suitable for smallholder contexts. In addition to satellite imagery, crop indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) play a crucial role in crop health monitoring without extensive field visits. NDVI quantifies vegetation health by comparing near-infrared (NIR) and red light reflectance, while NDWI assesses water content in vegetation, helping distinguish between water bodies and crops.

Deep learning models, including Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architectures, excel in analyzing crop growth patterns using sequential or time-series data. For instance, Khan et al. demonstrated that a Bi-LSTM model achieved over 94% accuracy in crop classification.

Parcel segmentation approaches, such as the Segment Anything Model for Geospatial (SAM-GEOs), are instrumental in delineating vegetation parcels and enhancing the accuracy of crop mapping, particularly in irregularly shaped smallholder fields. These innovative technologies and methods not only enable precise crop detection but also contribute to sustainable agricultural practices and informed decision-making in smallholder farming systems.

### Ground Truth Data Acquisition

Ground truth data acquisition is paramount for validating and training crop detection models, particularly in the context of smallholder farming where resources are limited and ground surveys can be challenging. Various methods have been employed to gather accurate data, each with distinct strengths and limitations.

Manual ground truth collection offers precise identification of features like crop boundaries and land cover, ensuring accuracy but requiring trained enumerators and significant time and cost investments. However, this method may pose challenges in smallholder regions due to resource constraints and logistical difficulties. Crowdsourcing and citizen science initiatives present scalable and cost-effective alternatives by engaging volunteers to collect data across diverse regions. While this method reduces expenses, ensuring data consistency and addressing biased participation remain challenges, especially in engaging smallholders who may require increased awareness and digital literacy.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide high-resolution imagery and rapid data acquisition, benefiting small fields during critical growth stages. Nonetheless, cost considerations and compliance with airspace regulations pose challenges, limiting access for smallholders lacking technological resources and expertise. Synthetic ground truth data allows the controlled creation of labeled datasets and scalability but may not fully represent real-world variability. For smallholders, ensuring the contextual relevance of synthetic data aligning with farming practices is essential. Satellite imagery serves as a proxy for ground truth, covering large areas with frequent revisit times. However, coarse resolution and difficulty in distinguishing mixed land cover pose challenges, especially given the heterogeneity of smallholder fields.

In summary, while manual methods ensure accuracy, innovative approaches like crowdsourcing, UAVs, synthetic data, and satellite imagery offer cost-effective alternatives for ground truth data acquisition. Addressing specific challenges faced by smallholders, such as resource constraints and technology access, will be crucial for enhancing data quality and promoting sustainable agriculture.

### Gaps in Existing Research

Crop mapping research, while advancing rapidly, reveals critical gaps, particularly in regions characterized by small-scale farming. These gaps must be addressed to enhance the precision, applicability, and impact of crop mapping technologies on smallholder agriculture.

One significant gap is the lack of standardized methodologies tailored to small-scale farms. Existing research often focuses on large-scale agriculture, overlooking the unique needs and constraints of smallholder farmers. Customizing methodologies for smallholder contexts is essential to ensure accuracy and relevance in crop mapping. Additionally, the limited availability of high-quality, high-resolution datasets for small-scale farming regions poses a significant challenge. Data sparsity and inadequate ground truth data hinder the development and validation of robust crop mapping models.

The research also highlights the need for more comprehensive studies on integrating machine learning algorithms with satellite imagery specifically for smallholder agriculture. While machine learning shows promise, further research is required to optimize algorithms for small-scale farming and address variations in image quality due to environmental factors. Moreover, research often neglects the socio-economic context of smallholder farming, including cultural practices, access to technology, and economic constraints. Understanding these contextual factors is crucial for designing crop mapping solutions that are practical and scalable for smallholder farmers.

In summary, addressing these gaps—standardizing methodologies for small-scale farms, improving dataset quality, optimizing machine learning integration, and considering socio-economic factors—is vital for advancing crop mapping research. Bridging these gaps will enhance the accuracy and applicability of crop mapping technologies, ultimately benefiting smallholder agriculture by promoting sustainable practices and informed decision-making.
